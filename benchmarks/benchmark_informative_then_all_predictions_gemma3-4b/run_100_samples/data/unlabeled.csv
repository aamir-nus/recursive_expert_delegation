Doesnt smell very nice.
"For me , this product would not be worth the $ 140 to purchase."
Know I like the smell of it.
Sometimes products tend to just sit on top
Serum was perfect
Foundation did not help !
Have not really noticed a difference though.
Lancome teint foundationss is my new favorite
Have not been able to see a ton of results
Over all a good foundation to use.
Foundation is blends into the skin so nicely over i skincare prep
Would recommend this foundation.
Is enough coverage on the first layer
Tasted awful .
Have uneven tones .
Foundation also offers great matte coverage.
M not fond of the smell .
Bars are loaded with protein
Horrible fishy taste
Is light for a full coverage.
Product feels so nice on the skin
Looks amazing.
Great results in just a week.
Really trust this brand its approved by the drug admin.
Am not a huge fan of caramel
Di do not leave my face feeling .
Slight smell is a bit perfumey .
Foundation worked beautifully on my combo dry Skin.
Wrinkles
Skin felt clean.
When I waited until the last minute it was way past my bed time lol
Product is great for helping you sleep .
Skin became dry itchy
Am beginning to see the texture of i skin Change.
Foundation is buildable
Serum is extremely hydrating !
Buy one Lancome product
Taste leaves al lot to be desired
Do not taste like chocolate at all
Still have some product look flaky in my dry spots
Think this product would be better for someone with normal skin type !
Face serum is very hydrating.
Product did exactly as promised
Other products from other vendors that are better in price.
Creams makes my face greasy
Had a breakout because its oily
Genetic rose floral smell is wish Luxe brands would break away from.
No strong smell

Have noticed a significant improvement when using this product.
Swore that i would never buy SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic Serum
Wrinkles I ve been fighting as I get older.
Bars are good that I have to force myself to just eat one
Foundation is not completely matte
Smell is not too strong.
Feels great on my oily skin.
Highly recommend adding this serum
"Now , I am left w out a serum option from Clinique."
Will not be continuing to buy.
Was worried about getting a rash.
Magnesium glycinate capsules are easy on my stomach
Have bad wrinkles under my eyes
Efficacy makes a worthwhile investment.
Pores look tiny
Strong perfume smell they put in this one.
Will definitely buy these magnesium gummies !
Wrinkles are appearing less noticeable - not as deep .
Could really find anything
Serums good
Taste absolutely horrible
Have been completely amazed at how different my joints feel since I started taking this.
Did not blend as much as I would like
The fragrance in the product broke me out.
Coverage is buildable without crossing the line into mask like.
Just do not think I notice any improvements to my skin.
Does not really have a heavy scent or anything
Less coverage
Am trying other brands.
Stop changing products Clinique clinique losing customers !.
Can not see much of a difference yet.
Is difficult for me to find a foundation
Can not say anything about wrinkles as 10 ml of the trial size was not enough to see any results in wrinkles
Flavor is almost non - existent
Will buy in the future.
Skin looks amazing
Brands are nt necessary
"Absolutely no change in "" real "" Wrinkles"

Cover up covered a lot.
Would recommend this foundation to anyone who likes long lasting foundations
Thought it smelled nice .
Am seeing results like i have never had Before
Found this formula disappointing
Covers everything I need to cover
Product is the best.
Maybe I am using this item wrong all together .
Problem is no matter This dries my skin .
Was Tan this shade would probably match
Matte foundation is not the best right now .
Product works really well under my eye .
Did not see really any difference.

Do not irritate my skin
Di do not see any improvement to fine lines to anything .

Nut I would still be wary of buying from this seller in the future.

Reason is due to the smell
Dry patches could be a thing of the past
Way foundation blends

"Foundation is a great fall , winter , spring foundation."
Can not get over this foundation.
Purchasing for myself in the future.

Really like how the serum felt on my skin.

Leaves skin looking bit greasy
"Product caused a lot of redness,,dryness , for me"
Most other protein bars lack much flavor .
Other vitamin gummies taste much better almost like candy
Smell was kind of gross.
Receive a bad box of these protein bars .
Will give it another try
Using certain primers helps considerably
