Iii Do not want to risk my skin getting irritated.

Do not feel that the foundation is full coverage.
Little breakouts go away pretty fast.
Before my skin was so dry .
Coverage is flawless
Reason is due to the smell
Actual vitamin tablet itselfs also does not produce an aftertaste like I have noticed with other vitamin c products.
Dry patches could be a thing of the past
Way foundation blends
Foundation goes on smoothly
Really did not get much of a chance to use this product.
Now I have to get a bottle !
Did nothing for my skin
Maybe a bit more oily skin would be better .
Just can not avoid the sun enough to utilize a Retinol product .
Is such a strange product.
Will order the protein bars again .
