Fine lines were slightly diminished .
Doesnt smell very nice.
"For me , this product would not be worth the $ 140 to purchase."
Know I like the smell of it.
Sometimes products tend to just sit on top
Serum was perfect
Foundation did not help !
Have not really noticed a difference though.
Lancome teint foundationss is my new favorite
Have not been able to see a ton of results
Really like the fact
Over all a good foundation to use.
Was able to get great Coverage with this foundation.
Foundation is blends into the skin so nicely over i skincare prep
Would recommend this foundation.
Slight tacky feel only lasted about a minute before my skin felt completely dry .
Is enough coverage on the first layer
Tasted awful .
Would buy again just in a different flavor if all possible
Have uneven tones .
Foundation also offers great matte coverage.
Not full coverage.
M not fond of the smell .
Bars are loaded with protein
Exact color shade was oxidizing
Lightest color is a tad too dark
Will not buy this flavor of Pure Protein bars again .
Horrible fishy taste
Is light for a full coverage.
Product feels so nice on the skin
To mention this serum has a tendency to oxidize before you have a chance to finish this serum.
Looks amazing.
Great results in just a week.
Wear care foundation has a good coverage
Really trust this brand its approved by the drug admin.
Am not a huge fan of caramel
Di do not leave my face feeling .
Slight smell is a bit perfumey .
Foundation worked beautifully on my combo dry Skin.
Wrinkles
Are very harsh on the skin.
Skin felt clean.
When I waited until the last minute it was way past my bed time lol
Negative is the actual package is a bit awkward to remove the product.
Product is great for helping you sleep .
Skin became dry itchy
Serum foundation helps my skin glow.
Serum feels great
Am beginning to see the texture of i skin Change.
Foundation is buildable
Have a great flavor !
Product also helps stay asleep
Am not a fan of the fragrance.
"Ok , prefer another flavor"
Things taste TERRIBLE
Serum is extremely hydrating !
Buy one Lancome product
Taste leaves al lot to be desired
Gummies really help you sleeping.
Serum feels really comfortable on my skin
Do not taste like chocolate at all
Still have some product look flaky in my dry spots
Think this product would be better for someone with normal skin type !
Face serum is very hydrating.
Am writing because I can not tell that with regular sleep pills I would suggest trying them if your having trouble sleeping.

Great coverage
Other products from other vendors that are better in price.
Creams makes my face greasy
"Luxury price tag , I m not that impressed ."

Mens vitamins have a good vitamin profile .
Bars are good that I have to force myself to just eat one
Noticed a few dry patches

Could really find anything
Serums good
Got to try the Natures Bounty Sleep 3 Gummies have helped me fall asleep faster !
Taste absolutely horrible
Have been completely amazed at how different my joints feel since I started taking this.
Sper lightweight feeling

The fragrance in the product broke me out.
Coverage is buildable without crossing the line into mask like.
Just do not think I notice any improvements to my skin.
Does not really have a heavy scent or anything
Fragrance is nt very strong .
Do have some inconsistency in skin.
Less coverage
Am trying other brands.
Stop changing products Clinique clinique losing customers !.

Can not say anything about wrinkles as 10 ml of the trial size was not enough to see any results in wrinkles
Flavor is almost non - existent

Will buy in the future.
Skin looks amazing
Brands are nt necessary
"Absolutely no change in "" real "" Wrinkles"

Skin became visibly glower with a week of daily usage.
"Feels heavy on i skin , sticky ."
Was able to tone the color i received down with some other shades.

Product does work.
Thought it smelled nice .
Foundation is a game changer !
Am seeing results like i have never had Before
Found this formula disappointing
Covers everything I need to cover
Product is the best.
Maybe I am using this item wrong all together .
Have noticed that the matte finish can be a bit drying .
Consistency is okay.
Overall the worst money I ve ever spent at Ulta.
Problem is no matter This dries my skin .
Was Tan this shade would probably match
Matte foundation is not the best right now .
Gummies have been a great addition to my nightly routine.
Does nt cause breakouts sensitive skin

Skin feels dirty
Best serum i have .

Do not irritate my skin
Di do not see any improvement to fine lines to anything .
Is so far the best I have found.
Wish this product came unscented.

Soft matte foundation.
"Pores,,Loss of radiance ."
Foundation definitely is not a full coverage foundation
Highly Recommended !
Why did lancome change the formula ?
Why would you stop selling a top product ?
Coverage goes along way
Fair light covers it all without looking heavy.
Dropper does nt stay stopped as much as some other bottles in that style.
It covers my acne scars
Cheeks are flakey Moisturizing product needed ?.
Hydrating serum ! !
Have learned that products with salycic acid is not good for Rosacea.

Could return that one
Face is feeling full of chunks of skin flaking off.
Staying power of this foundation is truly impressive.
Product just is not for me.

Cvs magnesium gummies serve as a great source to relieve minor magnesium deficiency .
Would not spend my money on the product.
Really am impressed with this foundation.
Coverage is light

Did not find that the serum did anything for fine lines in those two weeks
Red spots began to appear on my face after five days of use.
"Please , for the love of God"
Have found this one to be very effective too.
Skin was just glowing
Melatonin does not make me feel groggy the next day .
"However,,I am definitely not a fan of the Smell."
Definitely like this product .
Fatigued how my skin had been feeling .
Product absolutely corrects all discoloration.
Have mixed the shade with a different shade to help.
Was really wrong with this product.
Wanted this product to work
Flavor is not good enough .
Much better per my preference.
Consistency could be improved .
Little oily.

Of the cheap packaging
Suffer from hormonal acne.
Complexion look flawless
Again this box came with 2 products.
Switched to these from a more expensive brand !
Irritated my skin so uncomfortably
Iii Do not want to risk my skin getting irritated.
Are definitely better
Do not feel that the foundation is full coverage.
Little breakouts go away pretty fast.
Before my skin was so dry .
Coverage is flawless
Reason is due to the smell
Actual vitamin tablet itselfs also does not produce an aftertaste like I have noticed with other vitamin c products.
Dry patches could be a thing of the past
Way foundation blends
Foundation goes on smoothly
Really did not get much of a chance to use this product.
Now I have to get a bottle !
Did nothing for my skin
Maybe a bit more oily skin would be better .
Just can not avoid the sun enough to utilize a Retinol product .
Will order the protein bars again .
As for the bigger wrinkles did not seem to do anything noticeable to the bigger wrinkles.
Product was flaky .
Products also brightens the skin as well
Packaging works.
Maybe a tiny bit oily on my forehead.
Still too pricey for me to buy a whole bottle.
Product smelled like beer .
Very much dislike the packaging dispensing.
"Otherwise , I would have to say that the product was not worth the price."

Shy away from yellow undertones

Plan to continue to see the results.
